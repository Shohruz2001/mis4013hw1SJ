        <h4>Geography</h4>
        <p>Tajikistan is a landlocked country in Central Asia, bordered by Afghanistan, China, Kyrgyzstan,
          and Uzbekistan. Approximately 93% of the country's territory is mountainous, with the Pamir Mountains,
          often called the "Roof of the World," housing some of the highest peaks, including Ismoil Somoni Peak
          at 7,495 meters. These towering ranges dominate the landscape and provide dramatic scenery, making 
          Tajikistan a haven for mountaineers and nature enthusiasts. The country's rivers, like the Amu Darya 
          and Panj, and glaciers, including the Fedchenko Glacier—the largest non-polar glacier—are critical for 
          both agriculture and hydropower, shaping Tajikistan’s geography and economy.</p>

      <section id="section2">
        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>
Tajikistan's history spans thousands of years, with the region playing a key role in ancient Persian empires, and
          later coming under the influence of Alexander the Great, Arab invaders, and the Mongols. In the 19th 
          century, it became part of the Russian Empire, and after the Russian Revolution, Tajikistan was incorporated
          into the Soviet Union in 1929. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Tajikistan declared its independence
          in 1991. However, the country soon faced a devastating civil war from 1992 to 1997, which resulted in significant
          loss of life and economic hardship. The civil war left deep scars on the nation, but the subsequent peace 
          agreement helped establish a fragile stability, allowing the country to slowly rebuild.</p>

      <section id="section3">
        <h4>Economy</h4>
        <p>Tajikistan's economy is heavily reliant on agriculture, aluminum production, and hydropower, with the latter
          accounting for nearly all of the country's electricity generation. The fertile Fergana Valley supports a significant
          portion of its agricultural output, including cotton, fruits, and grains. Additionally, Tajikistan is rich in natural
          resources such as gold, silver, and uranium, though many of these resources remain underdeveloped. Aluminum production,
          centered at the Tajik Aluminum Company (TALCO), is one of the country's main industrial exports. Remittances from Tajik
          citizens working abroad, especially in Russia, play a crucial role in the economy, often exceeding half of the nation's
          GDP, making Tajikistan one of the most remittance-dependent countries in the world.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="section4">
        <h4>Tourism</h4>
        <p>Tourism in Tajikistan is steadily growing, driven by the country's breathtaking natural landscapes and rich cultural
          heritage. The Pamir Highway, one of the highest and most scenic roads in the world, is a major draw for adventure travelers,
          offering stunning views of the Pamir Mountains and access to remote, traditional villages. In addition to the dramatic 
          mountain scenery, Tajikistan's ancient Silk Road sites, such as the Hisor Fortress and the ruins of Sarazm, provide visitors
          with a glimpse into the region's long and diverse history. With its blend of adventure, history, and hospitality, Tajikistan
          is becoming an increasingly popular destination for those seeking off-the-beaten-path travel experiences.</p>
